Plan:

-   Mobile app built with React Native and SQLite that is a combined journal and to do list

-   Emphasis on a daily "reflection" at the bonfire, defining, updating, and reflecting on goals

Rest Functionality:

-   The daily rest allows for users to freely journal and upload a picture, before responding to a few generated prompts, and finally assigning tasks for the next day

-   A weekly long rest has the same functionality as the short rest, but prompts the user to set and adjust weekly goals and reflect on your matching them

-   At the end of each rest, the contents will be appended to a SQL Table storing images, text prompts and answers

Home Page:

-   Home Page displays the to-do list established the night before, with options to check off, delete, or add new tasks

Journal Page:

-   Journal Page allows you to view your past notes and reflections

Projects:

-   Set up weekly / monthly goals for spending time working on these projects and goals

App Setup:

-   First time configuration will structure what types of questions are asked during each rest, as well as what sorts of
